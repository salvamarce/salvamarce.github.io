I received my master’s degree in Automation Engineering from the University of Naples Federico II. In November 2020 I won the scholarship funded by Leonardo S.p.A for the three years challenge called ["Leonardo Drone Contest"](https://www.leonardo.com/it/innovation-technology/open-innovation/drone-contest). I took my PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (DIETI) in the [PRISMA Laboratory](http://prisma.dieti.unina.it/) of the same institution. Within my research group, I was also involved in different industrial and EU-funded research projects focused on several topics, such as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for inspection and maintenance. During my PhD I also spent six months at [Inria center at Rennes University](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) as a visiting student, working under the supervision of Dr Paolo Robuffo Giordano and Dr Marco Tognon.
After my PhD, I worked as a consultant on different projects for the [CREATE](https://www.create.unina.it/) consortium and the company [Neabotics.](http://www.neabotics.com/)

|RESEARCH ACTIVITIES||

The following is the list of the research activities conducted by Salvatore Marcellini:

- Closed-loop sensitivity for trajectory planning : Planning of state-trajectories robust with respect to parameters’ uncertainties. This theory has been applied both to standard and tilting multirotors.
- Control of tilt-rotor multicopter : Development of novel control techniques for drone-environment in- teraction and infrastructure inspection. The aim of this research activity is to develop a UAV capable of performing autonomous or semi-autonomous measurements in contact with the environment.
- UAV autonomous navigation in Indoor/GPS-denied : In this field, the research is mainly focused on environment-aware trajectory planning and safe navigation.
